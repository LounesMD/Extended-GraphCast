# Extended-GraphCast

An Efficient finetuning approach for Extended GraphCast.


## Overview

This project aims to provide an open-source and user-friendly framework to use and enhance **GraphCast**, a powerful ML weather forecasting model. Our focus is on simplifying the finetuning process and significantly expanding the output to include a broader range of weather variables.
